Simple Youtube UI clone(ish) using React, search as you type without page reloads!

Site is live at:
https://reactjs-youtube.herokuapp.com/

Give it a couple seconds to boot up, as I am using Heroku's free hosting and the dynos take a little bit to start.


If you want to fiddle with it:
clone, then run `npm install`, and `npm start`.
